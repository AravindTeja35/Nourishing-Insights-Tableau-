# Nourishing Insights: Analyzing Global Food Insecurity & Socio-Economic Trends (Tableau)

**Introduction**

The project is a comprehensive analysis project focused on examining global food insecurity from 2000 to 2022. The project explores the paradoxical existence of food abundance alongside scarcity, attributing this phenomenon to various factors such as climate change, economic disparities, and geopolitical tensions. By leveraging advanced analytics and visualization capabilities of Tableau on extensive datasets, our goal is to uncover the underlying causes of food insecurity and offer insights into mitigating this global challenge.

**Objective**

The primary objective of our project is to use Tableau to analyze and visualize  global food insecurity statistics, correlating them with factors like GDP per capita, population growth, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and income inequality. Our analysis seeks to provide a deeper understanding of food insecurity's roots and its relation to 21st-century human activities, aiming to contribute to more effective strategies against this persistent issue.

**Dataset Description**

The project utilizes six datasets covering aspects such as GDP per capita, food insecurity rates, income inequality, world population growth, COVID-19 case numbers, and average food grain prices. These datasets are sourced from reputable organizations including the IMF, FAO, OECD, The World Bank, and WHO, providing a robust foundation for our analysis.

**Analysis**

This project consists of three main components: the overarching trend in food insecurity during the 21st century, the correlation between major events and food insecurity rates, and the relationship between economic indicators and food insecurity. Our objective is to grasp the overall food insecurity rate trend, using it as the foundation for assessing the hypothesis that 'major events (e.g., COVID) and economic factors impact food insecurity rates. We employ various visualization techniques, including boxplots and line charts, to illustrate the distribution of food insecurity rates across countries and their correlation with different factors.

**Conclusion**

Our findings indicate a significant decline in the global average rate of food insecurity, although countries with severe food insecurity still face fluctuating rates. Economic conditions appear to be a primary determinant of food insecurity rates, with no direct link established between major global events and food insecurity. The increase in food insecurity rates beyond the first decade of the 21st century correlates with the rising costs of staple cereals.
